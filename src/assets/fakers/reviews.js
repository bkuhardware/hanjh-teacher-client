To be honest, that goal is a bit ambitious for a single class. With that being stated, this ethical hacking class will teach you more than just a couple of tricks. You definitely learn the basic theory and techniques that ethical hackers actively use in the field use to pen test networks, from breaking into Wi-Fi, to ARP and DNS spoofing with Bettercap, to hooking browsers with Beef / malicious JavaScript code, to generating your own trojans with Veil, and even some basic web server and SQL techniques whenever you’re attacking computers on the internet. While you might not truly exit the class as an intermediate hacker, you aren’t going to be a total novice after taking this class. In fact, despite being a Windows user for years, I now feel much more comfortable using the Linux Terminal interface over the Command Prompt. That alone should show you how valuable this class is.</p><p>That doesn’t mean the class was perfect. Zaid says himself that it was designed to highly practical without neglecting theory. That’s absolutely correct, although there were times where I felt he could have gone a bit more in-depth. Now that may apply to me, a highly technical user with a CompTIA certification, but maybe it won’t apply to you if you don’t have as many years of IT experience and coding experience. To give you one example, at one point, he has you discover clients on the same subnet by using an IP range. In this example, because many students won’t understand networking principles to the extent that somebody like me does, Zaid doesn’t elaborate on why we use a /24 CIDR notation with a class C subnet. In other cases, he shows you some very basic JavaScript, AutoIT, and SQL coding. He then reminds the students this is not a programming course so he can’t elaborate further as it is not within the scope of the course.</p><p>All in all, this class was fantastic and was exactly what I wanted from a hacking course on Udemy. Professor Zaid, you rock man. You teased your more advanced classes throughout the course and built my skills and I have already purchased both your Python and Advance Networking courses. I’m doing an Active Directory and then Linux Command Line course before I resume your classes, but I’m thrilled to get to them. Thanks for everything.</p></div></div>`
